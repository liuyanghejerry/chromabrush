Open source version of the Chromabrush application, which is hosted at http://www.chromabrush.com.

Chromabrush is a sample painting application written using the latest HTML5 technologies.  It is intended to be a demonstration of how HTML5 can be used to create a rich web app, but is not intended as a production tool.  Therefore some features are limited or not optimized fully for a production setting.

Because this is a technical demonstration of what is possible to create when using cutting-edge features, less effort has been put into making the application work on all available browsers.  Currently, only the [dev channel of Google Chrome](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) is supported.
